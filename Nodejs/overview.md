# Overview

1. **What is Node.js?**  
   Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to run JavaScript code on the server side. It uses Google's V8 engine (also used by Chrome) to execute code, enabling JavaScript to be used for backend development, not just for client-side scripts in the browser.

2. **Why use Node.js?**  
   Node.js is widely used because it is fast, efficient, and scalable. It uses a non-blocking, event-driven architecture, making it ideal for real-time applications like chat apps, streaming services, and APIs. Developers also like it because it allows using JavaScript on both the frontend and backend, promoting code reuse and consistency.

3. **History of Node.js**  
   Node.js was created by Ryan Dahl in 2009. He was frustrated with the limitations of traditional web servers like Apache, particularly their blocking I/O. Node.js was designed to handle many simultaneous connections using a single thread and asynchronous I/O. Over time, it gained massive popularity, especially with the rise of JavaScript frameworks and full-stack development.

4. **Node.js vs Browser**  
   While both Node.js and browsers execute JavaScript, they serve different purposes. Browsers are designed for rendering HTML, CSS, and running JavaScript in the client (user's) environment, with limited access to system resources. Node.js, on the other hand, runs JavaScript on the server and has access to the file system, network, and other low-level APIs. Node.js doesn't have built-in DOM or window objects like browsers do.

5. **Running Node Code**  
   To run Node.js code, you need to install Node.js from [https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org). Once installed, create a file (e.g., `app.js`) with JavaScript code. Then open your terminal or command prompt and run:

   ```bash
   node app.js
   ```

   This executes the JavaScript code in the file using the Node.js runtime.
