# What is Automated Testing?

Automated testing uses software to run predefined test cases without manual input. Test scripts verify app behavior, performance, and reliability, enabling fast, repeatable, and scalable testing. It's crucial in modern development for maintaining quality, especially when integrated into CI/CD pipelines.

## Benefits of Automated Testing

1. **Speed**: Executes tests quickly, ideal for repetitive tasks.
2. **Consistency**: Eliminates human error in execution.
3. **Reusability**: Tests can be reused across versions.
4. **Cost-Efficient**: Saves long-term time and cost post-setup.
5. **High Coverage**: More scenarios and environments can be tested.
6. **Fast Feedback**: Quickly alerts developers of regressions.
7. **Parallelism**: Run tests on multiple platforms simultaneously.

## Types of Tests

1. **Unit:** Test small units (e.g., functions).
2. **Integration:** Validate interactions between components.
3. **Functional:** Confirm feature behavior matches requirements.
4. **End-to-End (E2E):** Simulate user flows from start to finish.
5. **Performance:** Measure speed, scalability (e.g., load/stress).
6. **Security:** Find vulnerabilities.
7. **Acceptance:** Validate business requirements.
8. **Regression:** Ensure updates don't break existing features.

## Test Pyramid

The **Test Pyramid** is a concept that suggests a balanced approach to automated testing, where different types of tests are used in a hierarchical manner:

1. **Base Layer - Unit Tests**: These are fast, reliable, and numerous tests that cover individual pieces of functionality. They should make up the majority of the test suite.
2. **Middle Layer - Integration Tests**: Fewer in number than unit tests, these tests focus on testing the interactions between different components or services.
3. **Top Layer - End-to-End (E2E) Tests**: These are the least numerous but the most comprehensive tests, simulating real user scenarios. They are slower and more complex but crucial for testing the overall system behavior.

The pyramid suggests that you should focus on having more unit tests and fewer end-to-end tests, ensuring a balanced and efficient test suite.

Here's a textual representation of the **Test Pyramid** diagram:

```
          End-to-End Tests (Top Layer)
             [Few tests, Slow execution]
                |----------------|
                |                |
      Integration Tests (Middle Layer)
         [Moderate number of tests, Moderate execution speed]
                |----------------|
                |                |
        Unit Tests (Base Layer)
      [Many tests, Fast execution, Focus on individual components]
```

- **Unit Tests (Base Layer)**: At the bottom, these tests are numerous, fast, and focused on testing small individual pieces of code, such as functions or methods.
- **Integration Tests (Middle Layer)**: The next level up involves testing how different components or modules of the application interact with each other. These tests are fewer in number than unit tests but more comprehensive.

- **End-to-End Tests (Top Layer)**: At the top, these are the least numerous but the most comprehensive tests, often involving a full simulation of the application from start to finish, including user interactions. They are slower and more resource-intensive.

This pyramid helps emphasize a strategy of having many unit tests, fewer integration tests, and the least number of end-to-end tests for optimal test coverage and efficiency.

## Tooling for Automated Testing

There are numerous tools available for automated testing, depending on the type of testing youâ€™re performing. Here are some popular ones:

   - **Jest** (JavaScript/React)
   - **Mocha** (JavaScript)
   - **JUnit** (Java)
   - **xUnit** (C#)
   - **pytest** (Python)

2. **Integration Testing**:

   - **Supertest** (Node.js)
   - **Postman** (API testing)
   - **Spring Test** (Java)

3. **End-to-End Testing**:

   - **Selenium**: Popular tool for automating browsers.
   - **Cypress**: Modern tool for E2E testing focused on speed and reliability.
   - **Puppeteer**: Provides high-level APIs to control Chrome or Chromium.

4. **Performance Testing**:

   - **JMeter**: Popular for load and stress testing.
   - **Gatling**: Performance testing tool focused on scalability.

5. **Continuous Integration (CI) / Continuous Deployment (CD)**:

   - **Jenkins**: Open-source automation server.
   - **CircleCI**: CI/CD platform for rapid deployment.
   - **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD workflow automation directly integrated with GitHub.

6. **Mocking and Stubbing**:
   - **Sinon.js**: Used for creating spies, mocks, and stubs in JavaScript.
   - **Mockito**: Popular in Java for mocking objects and stubbing methods.
